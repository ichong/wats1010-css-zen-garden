#Design Concept

My concept is basic in visual style with the main texts on the left side of the page and the designs and other action items on the right side. I listed the two download links on the top and placed a “zen” like photo in the header. It’s very similar to how I laid out the previous assignment. I really like the look of the main CSS design on the CSS Zen Garden page called [**Verde Moderna**](http://csszengarden.com/214/) by Dave Shea. I like the font and the flow of content. It feels clean and easy to locate the action links. I am hoping that the users will see my concept as similar with an easy navigation section and readability. [**Spring360**](http://www.csszengarden.com/205/) by Rene Hornig and [**OrderedZen**](http://www.csszengarden.com/133/) by Steve Smith are similar styles and where my inspiration for the concept.
